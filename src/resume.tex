\CoopWorkExperience

\Job{Precision Nanosystems}{September, 2018 -- December, 2018}{Instrumentation Engineer Co-op}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed and built equipment to run experiments on microfluidics devices
    \item Wrote reports documenting the results of microfluidics experiments
\end{itemize}

\TechnicalProjects

\TechnicalProject{Low Waste Tangential Flow Filtration}{November 2018 -- December 2018}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Built a device similar to the \href{http://spectrumlabs.com/filtration/KR2System.html}{KR2\textit{i} TFF System}
    \item Uses two syringe pumps connected directly to the filter instead of a peristaltic pump to reduce material lost due to tubing.
    \item Each syringe pump is capable of determining the volume of fluid contained within a syringe and allows for a user to specify a specific concentration ratio.
\end{itemize}

\TechnicalProject{\href{https://github.com/Gigahawk/mech223project_asds}{ASDS 2.x Sea-based Landing Pad Scale Prototype}}{January 2018}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Working with a group of 6 other students, worked through a formal engineering design process to build a boat capable of balancing and transporting model rockets
	\item Implemented a battery monitoring system to limit throttle based on power output, improving stability by preventing motor brownouts that would cause the boat to rock
	\item Wrote a class to remap controller inputs to a more intuitive control scheme allowing for greater control.
\end{itemize}
\pagebreak

\TechnicalProject{\href{https://github.com/Namtsua/bmbot}{BM Bot}}{January 2018}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Working with a group of 3 other friends, built a Discord bot using Node.js that would track user's League of Legends games
	\item Used the Riot Games API to detect when a user finished their game, and then would send messages to the user poking fun at them based on their performance
\end{itemize}
