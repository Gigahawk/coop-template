\TechnicalProjects

\TechnicalProject{Custom 3D Printer}{December 2016 -- Present}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lead a team of 5 in building an i3 based 3D printer
	\item Added a servo actuated pen to the printhead, allowing for multicolor prints without swapping filaments
	\item Wrote a GCode postprocessor to allow specific areas of a print to be colored
\end{itemize}

\TechnicalProject{\href{https://github.com/Gigahawk/SSC_Checker_Bot}{SSC Checker Bot}}{May 2018}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Built a Telegram bot using Python that checks for grades on UBC's Student Service Checker and notifies users when new grades come out
	\item Grades are stored in a database using SQLAlchemy to allow for database agnostic operation
\end{itemize}

\TechnicalProject{\href{https://github.com/Gigahawk/mech223project_asds}{ASDS 2.x Sea-based Landing Pad Scale Prototype}}{January 2018}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Working with a group of 6 other students, worked through a formal engineering design process to build a boat capable of balancing and transporting model rockets
	\item Implemented a battery monitoring system to limit throttle based on power output, improving stability by preventing motor brownouts that would cause the boat to rock
	\item Wrote a class to remap controller inputs to a more intuitive control scheme allowing for greater control.
\end{itemize}

\TechnicalProject{\href{https://github.com/Namtsua/bmbot}{BM Bot}}{January 2018}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Working with a group of 3 other friends, built a Discord bot using Node.js that would track user's League of Legends games
	\item Used the Riot Games API to detect when a user finished their game, and then would send messages to the user poking fun at them based on their performance
\end{itemize}

\StudentTeams
