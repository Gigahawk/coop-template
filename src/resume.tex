\TechnicalProjects

\TechnicalProject{Custom 3D Printer}{December 2016 -- Present}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lead a team of 5 in building an i3 based 3D printer
	\item Designed custom mounting solutions to enable compatibility with readily availible parts
	\item Added a servo actuated pen to the printhead, allowing for multicolor prints without swapping filaments
\end{itemize}

\TechnicalProject{\href{https://github.com/Gigahawk/mech223project_asds}{ASDS 2.x Sea-based Landing Pad Scale prototype}}{January 2018}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Working with a group of 6 other students, worked through a formal engineering design process to build a mobile floating platform capable of balancing and transporting model rockets
	\item Implemented a battery monitoring system that would limit throttle based on available power output, improving stability by preventing motor brownouts that would cause the boat to rock
	\item Remapped controller inputs to a more intuitive control scheme, allowing for effective piloting without practice
\end{itemize}

\TechnicalProject{Offline Transit App}{June 2017 -- Present}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Wrote a Python script to scrape the Translink API for every bus stop and corresponding routes into an SQLite database
	\item Built an Android app using the database that shows the user nearby bus stops with buttons to query individual bus times
\end{itemize}

\TechnicalProject{Automated Quoting Service Prototype}{October 2017 -- Present}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Wrote a Python program that would automatically generate price quotes whenever a user submitted a job to UBC Rapid's printing service, reducing quote times from up to 48 hours down to 10 minutes
	\item Leveraged multiple Google APIs to access Google Forms data
\end{itemize}

\StudentTeams

\StudentTeam{\href{http://ubc-rapid.com/}{UBC Rapid}}{October 2016 -- Present}
